## R Markdown
*Here we have some italics* and also **bold**
But you might want to see some `code`

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Here's some text and then R code: `r 2 + 2`

```{r}
storms %>%
  filter(status == "hurricane") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = pressure, y = wind))

```
